Road Accident dashboard


I have developed an accident dashboard using Tableau that provides valuable insights. The dashboard includes three filters: one for the current year, another for the previous year, and a third for selecting accident severity. On the left side of the dashboard, I have incorporated several key performance indicators (KPIs) to analyze year-on-year trends and different vehicle types involved in accidents. Furthermore, I have highlighted fatal casualties based on weather conditions, road surface conditions, road types, and accident locations. By adjusting the filters for the current and previous years, the right side of the dashboard dynamically reflects the corresponding changes.
